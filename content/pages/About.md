Hello! I am Ananya Srivastava, a junior studying Computer Science Engineering with a specialisation in AI. I am an intern at [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) where I work on reproducing scientific research using modern image processing pipelines. I have an interest in the intersection of AI and healthcare, the research projects that I like working on usually leverage advancements in machine learning and deep learning, and apply them to biomedical use cases.

In my spare time, you will find me spooking myself out with the latest Stephen King paperback and a cup of coffee. Here's my **[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43927183-ananya)**, I would love to connect with more book lovers! I also adore long walks and I have a well-loved journal on my bedside table.

This blog captures all my interests, from computer science and open-source development to mathematics to literature. I am here to give you a _Virtual View_ of the world!
Thanks for stopping by!
